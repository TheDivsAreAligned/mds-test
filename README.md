# McKinsey & Company

## Coding Assignment

applicant: Bart Budak

Before I begin this assignment... actually, wait, I wonder if Alex will even see this...

I'd like to thank the team for taking the time to consider my application. Alex, Besjon, Steve, Carlos, and Rajat,
it was such a plesaure speaking with you. The conversations from Thursday's call have really stuck with me; it felt
so natural to dicuss those topics with you all. The scope of the work which we discussed presents such a unique
interdisciplinary challenge. It's going to make for an amazing project. I'm ready to dive in, if you all are.

...and a smaller thank you to whoever stuck around long enough to read all of this.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
